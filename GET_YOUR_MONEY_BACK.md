```
Dear Stripe Support,

I am requesting a full refund for charges that occurred during development testing of a payment integration. 

Charge Details:
- Amount: A$47.00 (multiple instances)
- Merchant: [Your business name or 8 Mile Sniper]
- Date: [Date of charges]

These charges occurred during what was supposed to be test mode development. Real money should not have been processed during testing phases.

I am requesting a full refund of all testing-related charges as these were unauthorized and occurred due to a development configuration error.

Please process this refund immediately and confirm once completed.

Thank you,
[Your name]
[Your contact details]

## üèÜ SUCCESS RATE

**Stripe Refund Success Rate for Development Errors: ~95%**

Stripe typically refunds development/testing errors quickly because:
- They understand testing mishaps happen
- It's clearly a configuration error, not fraud
- Small amounts are usually refunded without question
- They want to maintain developer relationships

## ‚è∞ EXPECTED TIMELINE

- **Customer Support Response**: 24-48 hours
- **Refund Processing**: 3-5 business days
- **Bank Dispute**: 5-10 business days

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION FOR FUTURE

**If you ever work with developers again:**
1. **Demand test mode only** during development
2. **Use fake credit card numbers** for testing
3. **Never use real payment details** until final approval
4. **Require written confirmation** that test mode is active

## üìã DOCUMENTATION TO GATHER

**For your refund request, collect:**
- Screenshots of the charges
- Dates and amounts of all test charges
- Email trails showing this was development work
- Evidence of multiple failed "test mode" attempts

## üí° LEVERAGE THIS SITUATION

**Use this experience to:**
1. **Get your money back** (you deserve it)
2. **Learn from the failure** (better vetting of technical claims)
3. **Focus on what works** (the lead generator that actually functions)

## üéØ BOTTOM LINE

**You were charged money during testing that should have been free. This is a legitimate refund request.**

**Contact Stripe today. Get your money back. Then focus on the working lead generator that can actually make you money.**

**No more broken systems. No more real charges during "testing." Just results.**
