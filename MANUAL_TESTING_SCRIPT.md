## ðŸš¨ DEBUGGING LEAD CAPTURE ISSUES

If leads don't appear in admin dashboard:

### **Method 1: Browser Console Check**
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console Tab**
3. **Complete a lead capture**
4. **Look for**: "NEW LEAD CAPTURED!" message
5. **Check Storage**: Go to Application tab â†’ Local Storage â†’ Check 'millionUserLeads'

### **Method 2: Direct Storage Test**
1. **Open Browser Console** on admin page
2. **Run this code**:
```javascript
// Check if leads are stored
console.log('Stored Leads:', localStorage.getItem('millionUserLeads'))

// Manually add a test lead
const testLead = {
  fullName: "Manual Test User",
  email: "manual@test.com", 
  phone: "555-999-8888",
  company: "Manual Test Co",
  websiteAnalyzed: "example.com",
  auditScore: 75,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  leadId: "MANUAL_TEST_" + Date.now()
}

// Get existing leads or create new structure
let leads = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('millionUserLeads') || '{"totalLeads":0,"leads":[],"lastUpdated":""}')
leads.leads.push(testLead)
leads.totalLeads = leads.leads.length
leads.lastUpdated = new Date().toISOString()

// Save back to storage
localStorage.setItem('millionUserLeads', JSON.stringify(leads))

// Refresh page to see if lead appears
location.reload()
```

### **Method 3: Cross-Domain Issue Fix**
If leads still don't show:
1. **Same Browser Session**: Complete audit and check admin in same browser session
2. **Clear Storage**: Clear browser storage and try again
3. **Different Browser**: Test in incognito/private mode
