## ✅ **ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **🚨 FIX #1: "What You'll Get" Section - Demo Disclaimer Added**

**❌ PROBLEM:** Static demo scores (75/100, 45/100, etc.) could confuse users into thinking these were their actual results.

**✅ SOLUTION:** Added clear disclaimer banner above sample results.

**Added Disclaimer:**
```
ℹ️ SAMPLE RESULTS SHOWN BELOW
These are example scores for demonstration. Your actual results will be based on your specific website analysis.
```

**Visual Treatment:**
- Golden border and background highlight
- Clear messaging that these are samples
- Professional presentation
- Positioned above demo scores for maximum visibility

**RESULT:** ✅ **Users now clearly understand these are demonstration scores, not their actual results**

---

### **🚨 FIX #2: Endless Column Lines Eliminated**

**❌ PROBLEM:** Persistent vertical golden lines running down entire page creating unprofessional appearance.

**✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** Card element borders creating visual column divisions:
- `.preview-card` borders in "What You'll Get" section
- `.metric-card` borders in results section  
- `.chart-container` borders in charts section

**✅ SOLUTION:** Removed problematic borders and replaced with subtle shadows:

**Before:**
```css
.preview-card {
    border: 1px solid #f4c430; /* Creating lines */
}
.metric-card {
    border: 1px solid #f4c430; /* Creating lines */
}
.chart-container {
    border: 1px solid #f4c430; /* Creating lines */
}
```

**After:**
```css
.preview-card {
    border: none;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(244, 196, 48, 0.2); /* Subtle glow */
}
.metric-card {
    border: none;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(244, 196, 48, 0.2); /* Subtle glow */
}
.chart-container {
    border: none; /* Clean appearance */
}
```

**RESULT:** ✅ **No more vertical lines - clean professional layout with subtle visual separation**
