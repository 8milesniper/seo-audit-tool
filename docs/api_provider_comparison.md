## Recommendation

For our SEO audit tool, I recommend a hybrid approach, leveraging the strengths of both **Moz** and **DataForSEO**.

- **Moz:** We will use the Moz API for its industry-standard Domain Authority (DA) and Page Authority (PA) metrics, as well as its strong keyword research capabilities. The affordable pricing model makes it a great starting point for our tool.
- **DataForSEO:** We will use the DataForSEO API for its flexibility and cost-effectiveness. The pay-as-you-go model will allow us to scale our usage as our user base grows. We will use their APIs for SERP data, backlink analysis, and on-page crawling, supplementing the data we get from Moz.

This hybrid approach will allow us to create a comprehensive and cost-effective SEO audit tool that provides our users with a wealth of valuable data. We will also integrate with the **Google PageSpeed Insights API** for performance analysis, as previously researched.
