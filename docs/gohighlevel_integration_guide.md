# Go High Level Integration Guide

This document outlines the technical specifications and best practices for integrating our SEO audit tool with the Go High Level platform. The integration will focus on lead capture, CRM data enrichment, and workflow automation.

## 1. Authentication

- **Method:** OAuth 2.0
- **Details:** The Go High Level API v2 uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure authentication. Our tool will need to implement the standard OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain an access token, which will be used to make authenticated requests to the API.

## 2. Lead Capture and CRM Integration

Our tool will use the Go High Level API to create new contacts and enrich their profiles with data from our SEO audit.

- **Create Contact:**
    - **Endpoint:** `POST /contacts/`
    - **Functionality:** When a user submits their information to our SEO audit tool, we will use this endpoint to create a new contact in Go High Level.
- **Update Contact / Add Custom Data:**
    - **Endpoint:** `PUT /contacts/{contactId}`
    - **Functionality:** After the SEO audit is complete, we will use this endpoint to update the contact's record with the audit results. We will use custom fields to store key metrics, such as the overall SEO score, Core Web Vitals scores, and the number of critical issues found.
- **Custom Fields:**
    - **Endpoint:** (Assumed to be available through the Custom Fields V2 API)
    - **Functionality:** We will need to create a set of custom fields in Go High Level to store the data from our SEO audit. These fields will be used to display the audit results in the contact's profile and to trigger automations.

## 3. Workflow Automation

We will leverage Go High Level's workflow automation capabilities to create powerful follow-up sequences for the leads generated by our tool.

- **Workflows API:**
    - **Endpoint:** (Assumed to be available through the Workflows API)
    - **Functionality:** We will use the Workflows API to trigger automated workflows based on the data from our SEO audit. For example, we can create a workflow that sends a series of educational emails to users with a low SEO score, offering them tips and resources to improve their website. We can also create a workflow that notifies the sales team when a high-value lead (e.g., a user with a large website and a high number of critical issues) is generated.

## 4. Opportunities and Pipeline Management

While the specific documentation for the Opportunities API was not found during the initial research, the presence of opportunity-related permissions in the API documentation suggests that this functionality exists. We will need to investigate this further, but the ability to create and manage opportunities in Go High Level would be a valuable addition to our integration.

- **Create Opportunity:** (Assumed functionality)
    - **Functionality:** When a lead is generated, we could automatically create a new opportunity in the Go High Level sales pipeline.
- **Update Opportunity:** (Assumed functionality)
    - **Functionality:** We could update the opportunity's stage and value based on the user's engagement with our follow-up emails and their actions on their website.

## 5. Reporting and Dashboards

By pushing our SEO audit data into Go High Level, we will enable "8 Mile Sniper" to create custom reports and dashboards that provide a holistic view of their lead generation and sales pipeline. They will be able to track the performance of our SEO audit tool, measure the quality of the leads it generates, and identify the most promising opportunities.
